# Weather-Prediction
Professor LuValle worked for Bell Labs and after their fiberoptics were destroyed in Oklahoma following an unprecedented year of rainfall, Professor LuValle seized the opportunity to study chaotic systems by working out his own models to predict annual rainfall and temperature using local weather station data collected by NOAA. Through his research he found single point estimates and confidence intervals to be innacurate and insufficient at predictions. He turned to creating probability densities based on multiple regression models of lagged variables. We were tasked with understanding, streamlining, testing, and building upon his unique ideas and code.
