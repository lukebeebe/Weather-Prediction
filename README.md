# Weather-Prediction
Professor LuValle worked for Bell Labs and after their fiberoptics were destroyed in Oklahoma following an unprecedented year of rainfall, Professor LuValle seized the opportunity to study chaotic systems by working out his own models to predict annual rainfall and temperature using local weather station data collected by NOAA. Through his research he found single point estimates and confidence intervals to be innacurate and insufficient at predictions. He turned to creating probability densities based on multiple regression models of lagged variables. We were tasked with understanding, streamlining, testing, and building upon his unique ideas and code.

- _data_
  - _HF_data.R_ - Dataframe which contains original values for Hawaii and Fresno locations
  - _fresno_data.R_ - Dataframe which contains scaled values for Fresno locations (scaled per location, not season)
  - _hawaii_data.R_ - Dataframe which contains scaled values for Hawaii locations (scaled per location, not season)
- _original code_ - Professor LuValle's original code and pdf sent to us
- _kc_main.R_ - Kavi's streamlined code __(work in progress)__
- _lb_main.R_ - Luke's streamlined code __(work in progress)__
